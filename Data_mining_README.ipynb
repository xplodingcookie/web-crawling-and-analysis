    "<h4>Task 1: Get All Links</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Guiding context: It may be useful for evaluating the quality and correctness of the process to initially examine the links which are in scope. Links excluded from the analysis will be those which will not be successfully retrieved or those which are beyond the scope of your task in evaluating the pipeline (e.g. links outside the current domain). In verifying your work, it is worth keeping in mind that errors earlier in the pipeline are more likely to lead to larger issues later in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function task1(..) in task1.py that takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument is a list of starting links in the format of a list of strings and \n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument is a filename. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should crawl each starting link and output a json formatted output file with the filename given in second argument and should be in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "{pageX: [linkXA, linkXB, ...], pageY: [linkYA, linkYB], ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "where pageX and pageY  are the starting link strings, linkXA and linkXB are the pages found through crawling starting from pageX, and  linkYA and linkYB are pages found through crawling starting from pageY.\n",
    "\n",
    "All URL strings should be fully qualified, including the protocol e.g. http://115.146.93.142/samplewiki/A12_scale should be used, even if the actual link found on the page is /samplewiki/A12_scale. Each webpage should be included in the list for each starting link only once and the list should be sorted alphabetically. You must crawl only links in the same domain as the starting link strings and should not include any links in the output which are not successfully retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to write any helper functions (even in another file) if you like, but do not change the function definition of task1(..). For example, do not add any additional arguments to task1(..). This applies to all tasks.\n",

    "To run your solution, open the terminal and run python main.py task1 full . You can verify your answer against the sample data using python main.py task1 sample, this will check the output against the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for all tasks, the sample data verification is not intended to verify the correctness of your approach or the structure of your solution. Verifying your output and process are correct is part of all tasks, so you should treat it as a sanity check, ensuring you haven't missed any aspects of basic formatting. In all tasks, this sample used for verification should be considered arbitrarily selected, so there is no implicit guarantee or expectation that it will cover all cases or highlight issues present in the full scale task.\n",
    "\n",

For Task 2, your code will not be tested on URLs which are excluded under robots.txt, but you are certainly welcome to handle this behaviour there as well if you like."

    "\n",
    "Guiding context: For this task, we are looking at a single page to see that we are successfully processing its content before we apply this process to all pages in later tasks. To make this as useful as possible for diagnosing issues which might affect later tasks, we will perform all steps in the pre-processing, this will include removing common elements not related to the content of the page (e.g. navigation menus and quality issues) and to remove low information words. The output is intended to be a list of words, useful to compare against the HTML page to see what has been removed and what has been retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warning, this kind of task is historically error prone, it is critically important to understand what you are doing at each and every step and to consider additional methods to verify your approach - any error in any step of your approach can lead to either subtle errors or major errors, both of which are unacceptable in good data science. At some point in your approach, it is strongly recommended you spend a bit of time thinking about and trying alternative approaches and that you investigate any discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task you should use BeautifulSoup. Each page will contain a div with the id of mw-content-text , which processing will be restricted to. You can use inspect element tool on one of the pages (or through Wikipedia itself) to see what this typically covers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function task2(..) in task2.py which takes a URL and a filename and outputs a json formatted file with that filename. The format of the JSON object output should be the name of the URL as the string and the value should be a list of words. If the page cannot be retrieved, the list should contain no values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The page fetched should be encoded to its apparent_encoding attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should save its output to the filename given in the second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two stages of pre-processing should occur, the first narrowing down and removing all irrelevant elements from the page, and the second which produces word tokens and removes irrelevant tokens. The first stage comprises eight steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the rest of the steps, operate on the div element with id of mw-content-text discarding other parts of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the remaining page tree, remove all th elements with the class of infobox-label.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the remaining page tree, remove all div elements with the class of printfooter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the remaining page tree, remove all div elements with the id of toc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. From the remaining page tree, remove all table elements with the class of ambox.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. From the remaining page tree, remove all div elements with the class of asbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. From the remaining page tree, remove all span elements with the class of mw-editsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. From the remaining mw-content-text tree, extract the text from the page using BeautifulSoup, this extraction should use a space separator (' ') between elements, and should not connect text from adjacent elements. For example if a section of the remaining tree contents were a b it should become 'a b' , not 'ab'.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first stage's step 1 -- 8 have been completed, the remaining text should be converted to tokens in the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change all characters to their casefolded form and then normalize all page text to its NFKD form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convert all non-alphabetic characters (for example, numbers, apostrophes and punctuation), except for spacing characters (for example, whitespaces, tabs and newlines) and the backslash character ('\\') to single-space characters. For example, '&' should be converted to ' '. You should consider non-English alphabetic characters as non-alphabetic for the purposes of this conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convert all spacing characters such as tabs and newlines into single-space characters, and ensure that only one whitespace character exists between each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The text should then be converted to explicit tokens. This process should use single-space characters as the boundary between tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Remove all stop words in nltkâ€™s list of English stop words from the tokens in the page text.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Remove all remaining tokens that are less than two characters long from the page text.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Each token should then be converted to its Porter stemming algorithm stemmed form. This should use all the default improvements present in the NLTK PorterStemmer (including both the additional improvements beyond the original algorithm and NLTK's improvements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though you are expected to ensure and verify all steps are correctly carried out, if you decide to use library functions for step 4, it is critically important you carefully read and fully understand the documentation as failing to read documentation could lead to major errors in pre-processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once steps 1 -- 7 are done, build a JSON file representing the page.  The JSON file should contain a JSON object containing one string matching the fully qualified url requested and the associated value should be an array of strings corresponding to the tokens produced by the above pre-processing.\n",
